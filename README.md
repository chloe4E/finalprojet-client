## Description

This application uses AI to generate cover letters. It takes simple inputs such as your name, surname, work experience described in one paragraph, and a copy paste of the job description you are applying to. With this set of information it generates a cover letter that you can edit and save. [Try it here](https://cover-letter-generator.netlify.app/)
